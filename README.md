# excel-bugs
Excel bug can't evict. Working on a database of tallying school championships per sport. After so many minutes working &amp; entering talleys, you visit the next cell &amp; it won't let you enter a number. The cell turns blue. So you figure the machine is slow. You try to go to another sheet inside your workbook &amp; it lights up as open. Now you have 2 sheets open at the same time &amp; you can't enter data in either. Sometimes you try to scroll down to a specific cell block by block. The down arrow takes you down to the end of the page &amp; does not go block by block. I have to constantly log off my entire pc &amp; reboot. I have tried pc matic cleaner on a daily basis &amp; can't get regular results.
